# Charm Patch

This is a collection of small changes that I think improve the balance of certain charms in the game. This should be fully compatible with Excempt-Medic's Charm Overhaul mod.

Fury of the Fallen has a chance while active to negate damage taken.

Dashmaster reduces the cooldown of Shadow Dash in addition to regular Dash.

Joni's Blessing gives more Lifeblood Masks.

Carefree Melody has a chance to heal when triggered.

Heavy Blow increases the damage dealt by Nail Arts.

Longnail and Mark of Pride increase the range of Nail Arts.

Quick Slash reduces the charge time of Nail Arts.

Additionally, I added a compatibility patch so that TheMathGeek314's Unlimited Hiveblood mod heals Lifeblood Masks (including those not given by Joni's Blessing)
in addition to regular ones. 

WARNING: I couldn't figure out how to manipulate the Lifeblood healing process directly, so you won't actually see the regenerated Masks in your health bar.

# Recommended Charm Changer Settings

Set Dreamshield cost to 2

Set Grimmchild Attack Cooldown to 1.33

Set Baldur Shell Blocks to 6

OPTIONAL - Instead of using Joni's Kindness, you can set Joni's Blessing Health Increase to 60%
