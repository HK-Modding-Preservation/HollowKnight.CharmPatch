# Charm Patch

This is a collection of small changes that I think improve the balance of certain charms in the game. This should be fully compatible with Excempt-Medic's Charm Overhaul mod.

Dashmaster reduces the cooldown of Shadow Dash in addition to regular Dash.

Dreamshield costs 2 notches instead of 3.

Grimmchild has an increased attack rate.

Fury of the Fallen has a chance while active to negate damage taken.

Carefree Melody has a chance to heal when triggered.

Baldur Shell blocks more attacks.

Joni's Blessing gives more Lifeblood Masks.

Additionally, I added a compatibility patch so that TheMathGeek314's Unlimited Hiveblood mod heals Lifeblood Masks (including those not given by Joni's Blessing)
in addition to regular ones. 
WARNING: I couldn't figure out how to manipulate the Lifeblood healing process directly, so you won't actually see the regenerated Masks in your health bar.
They are there, however.
