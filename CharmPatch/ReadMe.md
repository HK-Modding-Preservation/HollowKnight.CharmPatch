# Charm Patch

This is a collection of small changes that I think improve the balance of certain charms in the game. This should be fully compatible with Excempt-Medic's Charm Overhaul mod.

Fury of the Fallen has a chance while active to negate damage taken.

Dashmaster reduces the cooldown of Shadow Dash in addition to regular Dash.

Joni's Blessing gives more Lifeblood Masks.

Carefree Melody has a chance to heal when triggered.

Additionally, I added a compatibility patch so that TheMathGeek314's Unlimited Hiveblood mod heals Lifeblood Masks (including those not given by Joni's Blessing)
in addition to regular ones. 
WARNING: I couldn't figure out how to manipulate the Lifeblood healing process directly, so you won't actually see the regenerated Masks in your health bar.

# Patch Notes
1.1.0.0 -	Added menu options so upgrades could be toggled. 
			Changed Dark Dashmaster's cooldown reduction from 33% to 40%
			Removed the following upgrades as they are already handled by Exempt-Medic's Charm Changer mod:
				Cheaper Dreamshield - Reduced cost of Dreamshield by 1. Use CharmChanger to set Dreamshield cost to 2.
				Ferocious Grimmchild - Increased Grimmchild attack speed by 33%. Use CharmChanger to set Grimmchild Attack Cooldown to 1.33.
				Outer Shell - Added 2 extra hits to Baldur Shell. Use Charm Changer to set Baldur Shell Blocks to 6 instead of 4.
				NOTE - Joni's Kindness increases the the health gained from Joni's Blessing by 2. This is still available, but you can achieve a similar effect if you use Charm Changer to set Joni's Blessing Health Increase to 60%.
